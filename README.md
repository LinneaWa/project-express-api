# Project Express API

Create and API using Express.
I also chose a new dataset. I used Kaggle to get the dataset by downloading a CSV file, renaming columns to be more JSON friendly, and then using a service to convert from CSV to JSON.

## The problem

✅ Your API should have at least 2 routes.

✅ A minimum of one endpoint to return a collection of results (array of elements).

✅ A minimum of one endpoint to return a single result (single element).

✅ Your API should be RESTful.

✅ On routes which return a single item, handle when the item doesn't exist and return some useful data in the response.

If I had more time I would like to have: 

✓ Accept filters via query parameters to filter the data you return from endpoints which return an array of data.

✓ Build a frontend which uses your API in some way to show the data in a nice way
